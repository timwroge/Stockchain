# Stockchain
Stock simulation tool

## Scope

Our product is called StockChain. StockChain is a website that will allow users to buy, sell, and short stocks on the stock market as if they had real money. Users can track their positions whenever they login to the site which will teach them more about how the market works and without the risk of buying real stocks. The objectives and goals we would like to meet include adding functionality to allow users to buy stocks, sell stocks, short stocks, and see how each transaction has overall affected their position over time. Users will be started with a specific amount of “capital” that they will be able to spend however they choose and will only be able to spend the amount of money they are allotted. The account will mimic a real stock buying application as best possible. The primary objective is to provide a simulation capable of showing the performance of various trading strategies. This will allow users to learn the aspects of investing in the stock market such as buying, selling, and shorting various stocks.
